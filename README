README for the arctica-keyring package
=======================================

The Debian project wants developers to digitally sign the
announcements of their packages, to protect against forgeries.

This package provides gpg keys for Arctica package repository.

For further information on keyrings refer to the Debian package
,,debian-keyring''.
